# LocalFileShare

An attempt at file "sharing" (sending/receiving) using local wlan on 3ds
Kind of working but riddled with desyncing problems

I *HEAVILY* recommend hosting on an o3ds (*NOT* a 2DS) as it has a physical switch for wireless, so if it desyncs just flip it and press START on all consoles then retry.
